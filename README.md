# Fysiikkapeli
TODO:
* ~~Improve player collision~~ 
  * ~~Getting back to this later, feels decent for now~~
  * ~~Nevermind, found bugs, should be better again~~
  * Fixed again?
* Add levels
  * Total 7+1 levels now. Want to have more like 30 before I'd call this something
  * There's a level editor now. Press CTRL+E to access, WASD to move things around, arrows to resize, tab to switch between objects, CTRL+S to save to a file (no way to load from file yet) and CTRL+P to resume game
* Menu
* Rebind keys
* ~~Improve player - moving platform interaction~~
  * ~~Supports faster moving platforms now and players move with them. Need to make code tidier there though~~
  * Platforms are buggy af, but at least code is tidier
* ~~Make a bigger level~~
* Work on special system: Collect temporary power-ups? Make special finite? 
  * 3 different rules for special in maps: No special, recharging special, no recharging
  * 4 power-ups, only one of them does anything, which is refill special
  * Special can be used to boost higher while in air going up
* Add special interactions to levels (perhaps something that flings you at high speed?)

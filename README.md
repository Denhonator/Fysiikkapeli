# Fysiikkapeli
TODO:
* ~~Improve player collision~~ 
  * Getting back to this later, feels decent for now
* Add levels
  * Total 6 levels now. Want to have more like 30 before I'd call this something
* Menu
* Rebind keys
* ~~Improve player - moving platform interaction~~
  * Supports faster moving platforms now and players move with them. Need to make code tidier there though
* Make a bigger level
* Work on special system: Collect temporary power-ups? Make special finite? 
* Add special interactions to levels (perhaps something that flings you at high speed?)

## How to play
Go to Project2/x64/Relase or Debug to find the .exe. Only Debug folder has conf.cfg (whoops), the versions are identical atm.

# Controls
WASD and arrow keys to move.
For WASD, hold Q and A, W or D to go fast but use special.
With arrow keys, use RCTRL.
Hold up to boost yourself when going up. Recharge this by landing on ground.
Bounce.

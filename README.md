# Fysiikkapeli
TODO:
* ~~Improve player collision~~ 
  * Getting back to this later, feels decent for now
* Add levels
  * Total 6 levels now. Want to have more like 30 before I'd call this something
* Menu
* Rebind keys
* ~~Improve player - moving platform interaction~~
  * Supports faster moving platforms now and players move with them. Need to make code tidier there though
* Make a bigger level
* Work on special system: Collect temporary power-ups? Make special finite? 
* Add special interactions to levels (perhaps something that flings you at high speed?)
